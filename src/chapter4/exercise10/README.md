#### Chapter 4 - Exercise 10
* Description

We are given a set of S containing n real numbers and a real number x, and
seek efficient algorithms to determine whether two elements of S exist whose
sum is exactly x.

(a) Assume that S is unsorted. Give an O(n log n) algorithm for the problem.
(b) Assume that S is sorted. Give an O(n) algorithm for the problem.
