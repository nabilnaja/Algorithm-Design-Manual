#### Chapter 4 - Exercise 10
* Description

We are given a set of S containing n real numbers and a real number x, and
seek efficient algorithms to determine whether two elements of S exist whose
sum is exactly x.

(a) Assume that S is unsorted. Give an O(n log n) algorithm for the problem.
(b) Assume that S is sorted. Give an O(n) algorithm for the problem.

* Solution

(a) We sort the array then we adapt and use the first solution in exercise 6. The time complexity would be O(n log n)
(b) We simply adapt and use the first solution in exercise 6. The time complexity would be O(n)


We can adapt and use the the third solution of exercise 6, if we use this solution it doesn't matter if the array is sorted or not.
The time complexity would be O(n)
