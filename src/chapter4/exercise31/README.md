#### Chapter 4 - Exercise 31

* Description

Stable sorting algorithms leave equal-key items in the same relative order
as in the original permutation. Explain what must be done to ensure that
mergesort is a stable sorting algorithm.

* Solution

when merging two subarrays we choose first the value with the lowest index when two values are equals.
