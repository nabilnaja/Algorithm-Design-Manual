#### Chapter 4 - Exercise 12
* Description

Give an efficient algorithm to compute the union of sets A and B, where
n = max(|A|, |B|). The output should be an array of distinct elements that form
the union of the sets.

(a) Assume that A and B are unsorted arrays. Give an O(n log n) algorithm
for the problem.

(b) Assume that A and B are sorted arrays. Give an O(n) algorithm for the
problem.
