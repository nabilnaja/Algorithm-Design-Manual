#### Chapter 4 - Exercise 4
* Description

Assume that we are given n pairs of items as input, where the first item
is a number and the second item is one of three colors (red, blue, or yellow).
Further assume that the items are sorted by number. Give an O(n) algorithm
to sort the items by color (all reds before all blues before all yellows) such that
the numbers for identical colors stay sorted.
For example: (1,blue), (3,red), (4,blue), (6,yellow), (9,red) should become (3,red),
(9,red), (1,blue), (4,blue), (6,yellow).
