#### Chapter 4 - Exercise 15
* Description

You are given a set S of n intervals on a line, with the ith interval described
by its left and right endpoints (li, ri). Give an O(n log n) algorithm to identify
a point p on the line that is in the largest number of intervals.
As an example, for S = {(10, 40), (20, 60), (50, 90), (15, 70)} no point exists in
all four intervals, but p = 50 is an example of a point in three intervals. You
can assume an endpoint counts as being in its interval.
