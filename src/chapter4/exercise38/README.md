#### Chapter 4 - Exercise 38

* Description

Let P be a simple, but not necessarily convex, n-sided polygon and q an
arbitrary point not necessarily in P. Design an efficient algorithm to find a line
segment originating from q that intersects the maximum number of edges of P.
In other words, if standing at point q, in what direction should you aim a gun
so the bullet will go through the largest number of walls. A bullet through a
vertex of P gets credit for only one wall. An O(n log n) algorithm is possible.

* Solution
