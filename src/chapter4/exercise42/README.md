#### Chapter 4 - Exercise 42

* Description

A Ramanujan number can be written two different ways as the sum of two
cubes—meaning there exist distinct positive integers a, b, c, and d such that
a3 + b3 = c3 + d3. For example, 1729 is a Ramanujan number because 1729 =
13 + 123 = 93 + 103.
(a) Give an efficient algorithm to test whether a given single integer n is a
Ramanujan number, with an analysis of the algorithm’s complexity.
(b) Now give an efficient algorithm to generate all the Ramanujan numbers
between 1 and n, with an analysis of its complexity.

* Solution
