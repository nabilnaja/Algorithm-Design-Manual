#### Chapter 4 - Exercise 28

* Description

Consider the following modification to merge sort: divide the input array
into thirds (rather than halves), recursively sort each third, and finally combine
the results using a three-way merge subroutine. What is the worst-case running
time of this modified merge sort?

* Solution

The time complexity is O(n log.base3 n)
