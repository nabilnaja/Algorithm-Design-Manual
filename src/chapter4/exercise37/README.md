#### Chapter 4 - Exercise 37

* Description

Consider the problem of sorting a sequence of n 0’s and 1’s using comparisons.
For each comparison of two values x and y, the algorithm learns which of
x < y, x = y, or x > y holds.
(a) Give an algorithm to sort in n − 1 comparisons in the worst case. Show
that your algorithm is optimal.
(b) Give an algorithm to sort in 2n/3 comparisons in the average case (assuming
each of the n inputs is 0 or 1 with equal probability). Show that your
algorithm is optimal.

* Solution
