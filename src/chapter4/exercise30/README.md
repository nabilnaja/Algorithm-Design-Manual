#### Chapter 4 - Exercise 30

* Description

Consider again the problem of merging k sorted length-n arrays into a single
sorted length-kn array. Consider the algorithm that first divides the k arrays
into k/2 pairs of arrays, and uses the merge subroutine to combine each pair,
resulting in k/2 sorted length-2n arrays. The algorithm repeats this step until
there is only one length-kn sorted array. What is the running time as a function
of n and k?
