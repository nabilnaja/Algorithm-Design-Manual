#### Chapter 4 - Exercise 7 
* Description

Give an efficient algorithm to take the array of citation counts (each count
is a non-negative integer) of a researcher’s papers, and compute the researcher’s
h-index. By definition, a scientist has index h if h of his or her n papers have
been cited at least h times, while the other n−h papers each have no more than
h citations.

* complexity analysis
  The time complexity is O(n log n).
