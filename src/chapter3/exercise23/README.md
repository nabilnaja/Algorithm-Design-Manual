#### Chapter 3 - Exercise 23
* Description

Assume we are given a standard dictionary (balanced binary search tree)
defined on a set of n strings, each of length at most l. We seek to print out all
strings beginning with a particular prefix p. Show how to do this in O(ml log n)
time, where m is the number of strings.
