#### Chapter 3 - Exercise 29
* Description

Extend the data structure of the previous problem to support insertions and
deletions. Each element now has both a key and a value. An element is accessed
by its key, but the addition operation is applied to the values. The Partial sum
operation is different.

• Add(k,y) – Add the value y to the item with key k.

• Insert(k,y) – Insert a new item with key k and value y.

• Delete(k) – Delete the item with key k.

• Partial-sum(k) – Return the sum of all the elements currently in the set

whose key is less than k, that is, i<k xi.
