#### Chapter 3 - Exercise 8
* Description

Tic-tac-toe is a game played on an n×n board (typically n = 3) where two
players take consecutive turns placing “O” and “X” marks onto the board cells.
The game is won if n consecutive “O” or ‘X” marks are placed in a row, column,
or diagonal. Create a data structure with O(n) space that accepts a sequence
of moves, and reports in constant time whether the last move won the game.

* complexity analysis

the time complexity is O(1) and space complexity is O(n), as required.
