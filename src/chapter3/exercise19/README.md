#### Chapter 3 - Exercise 19
* Description

Suppose you have access to a balanced dictionary data structure that supports
each of the operations search, insert, delete, minimum, maximum, successor,
and predecessor in O(log n) time. Explain how to modify the insert
and delete operations so they still take O(log n) but now minimum and maximum
take O(1) time. 

(Hint: think in terms of using the abstract dictionary
operations, instead of mucking about with pointers and the like.)
