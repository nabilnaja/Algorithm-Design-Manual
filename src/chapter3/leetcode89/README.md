#### Chapter 3 - LeetCode 89
* Description

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

* complexity analysis

the time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n).
