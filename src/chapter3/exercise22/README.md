#### Chapter 3 - Exercise 22
* Description

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

• insert(x) – Insert item x from the data stream to the data structure.

• median() – Return the median of all elements so far.

All operations must take O(log n) time on an n-element set.

* complexity analysis

Time complexity of add method is O(log n), while the time complexity of the median method is O(1).

The space complexity is O(n)
