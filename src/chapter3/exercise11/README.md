#### Chapter 3 - Exercise 11
* Description

Design a dictionary data structure in which search, insertion, and deletion
can all be processed in O(1) time in the worst case. You may assume the set
elements are integers drawn from a finite set 1, 2, .., n, and initialization can take
O(n) time.

* complexity analysis

As requested, the time complexity is O(1) for every operation. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the set.
