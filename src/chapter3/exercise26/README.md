#### Chapter 3 - Exercise 26
* Description

Suppose that we are given a sequence of n values x1, x2, ..., xn and seek to
quickly answer repeated queries of the form: given i and j, find the smallest
value in xi, . . . , xj.

(a) Design a data structure that uses O(n2) space and answers queries in O(1)
time.

(b) Design a data structure that uses O(n) space and answers queries in
O(log n) time. For partial credit, your data structure can use O(n log n)
space and have O(log n) query time.
