#### Chapter 3 - Exercise 12
* Description

The maximum depth of a binary tree is the number of nodes on the path
from the root down to the most distant leaf node. Give an O(n) algorithm to
find the maximum depth of a binary tree with n nodes.

* complexity analysis

the time complexity is O(n). Since we use Recursion ehe space complexity is O(h), where h is the depth of the tree.
