#### Chapter 3 - Exercise 5
* Description

We have seen how dynamic arrays enable arrays to grow while still achieving
constant-time amortized performance. This problem concerns extending
dynamic arrays to let them both grow and shrink on demand.

(a) Consider an underflow strategy that cuts the array size in half whenever
the array falls below half full. Give an example sequence of insertions and
deletions where this strategy gives a bad amortized cost.

(b) Then, give a better underflow strategy than that suggested above, one that
achieves constant amortized cost per deletion.
