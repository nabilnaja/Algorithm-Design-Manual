#### Chapter 3 - Exercise 17
* Description

Give an O(n) algorithm that determines whether a given n-node binary tree
is height-balanced

* complexity analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) as required. The space complexity is O(h) where h is the depth of the tree.

* Test

I used leetcode test cases and run the code on leetcode.
