#### Chapter 3 - Exercise 28
* Description

Let A[1..n] be an array of real numbers. Design an algorithm to perform
any sequence of the following operations:

• Add(i,y) – Add the value y to the ith number.
• Partial-sum(i) – Return the sum of the first i numbers, that is, i j=1 A[j].

There are no insertions or deletions; the only change is to the values of the numbers.
Each operation should take O(log n) steps. You may use one additional
array of size n as a work space.
