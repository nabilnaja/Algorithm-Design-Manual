#### Chapter 3 - Exercise 16
* Description

Find the storage efficiency ratio (the ratio of data space over total space)
for each of the following binary tree implementations on n nodes:

(a) All nodes store data, two child pointers, and a parent pointer. The data
field requires 4 bytes and each pointer requires 4 bytes.

(b) Only leaf nodes store data; internal nodes store two child pointers. The
data field requires four bytes and each pointer requires two bytes.
