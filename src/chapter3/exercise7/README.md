#### Chapter 3 - Exercise 7
* Description

Work out the details of supporting constant-time deletion from a singly
linked list as per the footnote from page 79, ideally to an actual implementation.
Support the other operations as efficiently as possible.

* complexity analysis
    
Deletion happen in constant time O(1), but only work if the deleted node is not the tail. 

We don't use any extra space, so the space complexity is O(1)
