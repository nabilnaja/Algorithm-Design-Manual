#### Chapter 3 - Exercise 3
* Description

Give an algorithm to reverse the direction of a given singly linked list. In
other words, after the reversal all pointers should now point backwards. Your
algorithm should take linear time.

     
* complexity analysis


Iterative solution, the time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(1)
Recursive solution, the time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n)
