#### Chapter 3 - Hackerrank Cycle Detection


* Description

A linked list is said to contain a cycle if any node is visited more than once while traversing the list. Given a pointer to the head of a linked list, determine if it contains a cycle. If it does, return 1. Otherwise, return 0.

* complexity analysis

The time complexity of this solution is O(n). 
Space complexity is O(1), since we don't use extra space.
