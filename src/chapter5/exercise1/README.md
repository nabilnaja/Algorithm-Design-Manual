#### Chapter 5 - Exercise 10
* Description

We are given n wooden sticks, each of integer length, where the ith piece
has length L[i]. We seek to cut them so that we end up with k pieces of exactly
the same length, in addition to other fragments. Furthermore, we want these k
pieces to be as large as possible.
(a) Given four wood sticks, of lengths L = {10, 6, 5, 3}, what are the largest
sized pieces you can get for k = 4? (Hint: the answer is not 3).
(b) Give a correct and efficient algorithm that, for a given L and k, returns the
maximum possible length of the k equal pieces cut from the initial n sticks.
